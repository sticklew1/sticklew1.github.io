	<p>Up and down the Outer Banks, there are a multitude of lighthouses, which were once used to serve as a navigational aid to ships at sea. One lighthouse, Ocracoke, is the US's second oldest lighthouse and still in operation, and Cape Hatteras Lighthouse is the tallest lighthouse in the US. Here is a list of lighthouses from north to south, and clicking on the names will link to visitor information.</p>

<h1>The beaches</h1>
<img src="images/sunset.jpg" alt="sunset">
<p>Perhaps the most popular attraction the Outer Banks offers is its beaches. They span the entire coastline, bordered by dunes towards land and the Atlantic Ocean. All of the beaches are public and free of businesses and boardwalks. There are a great amount of rental houses and hotels that have been built near the beach in recent years, making both getting to the beach and being able to spend it with family a breeze.</p>
