          <h2 class="cursivefont">What is Special Olympics?</h2>
          <p class="cursivefont">Special Olympics is the world's largest sports organization for children and adults with intellectual disabilities, providing year-round training and competitions to 5 million athletes and Unified States Sports partners in 172 countries. Special Olympics competitions are held every day, all around the worldâ€”including local, national and regional competitions, adding up to more than 100,000 events a year.</p>
          <h2 class="cursivefont">UM Special Olympics Club</h2>
          <p class="cursivefont"> The University of Miami Special Olympics Club began in 2014. It began as a bridge to serve the gap between the university and the Special Olympics organization. Special Olympics UM serves as a subsection of Special Olympics Miami-Dade, which is an umbrella organization that represents the entirety of Miami-Dade County. The main activities for the club include flag football, soccer, and basketball, which we practice in preparation for county competitions, and eventually state competitions at Walt Disney World.</p>
